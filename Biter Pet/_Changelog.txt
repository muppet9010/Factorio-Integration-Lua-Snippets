Version 2.0.0 - 2023-12-27
--------------------------

- Updated code to work with Muppet Streamer version 20.2.42. This version of the mod is a breaking change to the previous version for the Delayed Lua feature that the Biter Pet uses.
- No functional changes to the behavior or options of Biters Pet. So only the bit below the `--[[ CODE START ]]` needs updating to your integration tools. The options section at the top can remain unchanged.



Version 1.0.1 - 2022-12-06
--------------------------

- Death messages can be printed in chat again, in addition to as a label near the dead biter.
- Biter selection is from a table based on enemy force evolution, rather than being hard coded.
- Biters can have health bonus based on enemy force evolution. If enabled they get a combined real and bonus health bar above them. Bonus health regenerates at the same speed as a biters real health once it is fully healed.
- Biter labels and health bar are now dynamically around the edge (top and bottom) of a biter's graphics. Rather than being on top of the biter. This isn't quite perfect in all cases, but is close given I am reliant on imperfect data.
- Additional limitations and some workarounds listed in documentation.



Version 1.0.0 - 2022-12-04
--------------------------

- Biter Pet in its first release state. It is fully documented and all customisable settings are on the first lines of the script.
- The script is provided in a compressed form so its easier to copy/paste in to integration tools/script files.
